class TreeNode:
    """
    A node in a Binary Search Tree.

    Each node has:
        - val: The data stored
        - left: Reference to left child (smaller values)
        - right: Reference to right child (larger values)

    Unlike linked list nodes, tree nodes have TWO children,
    creating a branching structure instead of a linear chain.
